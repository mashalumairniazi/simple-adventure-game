# Simple Adventure Game

## Introduction

Welcome to my fourth GitHub repository! ðŸŽ‰ I'm an aspiring teen developer learning Python through various courses and increasing my skills as I go on. 
This project is an really simple text-based adventure game that showcases the concepts I've just learnt, mainly as while loops, for loops, input commands, and conditionals. 

## About the Project

This repository contains:

- `enhanced_adventure_game.py`: A Python script for a text-based adventure game that demonstrates the use of input commands, while loops, for loops, and conditionals.

## Game Mechanics

In this adventure game, you will:
- Make choices that affect the storyline.
- Engage in combat with different enemies, using attack and defend actions.
- Experience random elements like damage and defense values for more dynamic gameplay.

## Learning Progress

I'm learning Python through various online courses and tutorials. As I acquire new skills, I create projects to apply what I've learned and share my progress. This game is an example of my journey, highlighting my understanding of fundamental Python concepts. Stay tuned for more projects as I continue to enhance my programming skills!
